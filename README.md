VAAK is a college project under the TARP course. Under this course people had to make groups and come up with creative solutions to real world problems and implement them. Our group decided to make a project that helped specially-abled people who cannot speak by making a device that took input from their fingers in a fixed format(For example: American Sign Language), process it and play out the processed data via a speaker that is either interfaced with an android smartphone or simply a smartphone's inbuilt speaker. Members under the project are:

  - Naman Arora(Me)
  - Rishabh Agarwal
  - Soham Sengupta
  - Aditya Kshetriya
  - Arpan Satpathi
  - Rakesh
